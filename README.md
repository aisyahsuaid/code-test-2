## Code Test (Advanced Junior) - DirectlyApply
### Notes: 
- This should take no more than 2-3 hours to complete
- Use any language, technologies, frameworks, packages or libraries that you like. 
- We are looking for how you style your code (readable, comments etc), and also the functionality.

### Overview:
- DirectlyApply receives up to ten million jobs a day from a variety of sources. One of the big problems that we encounter is inconsistent data quality between the different sources
- Our goal is to make the experience for job seekers the best it can be. When data quality is poor, this often leads to a poor user experience.
- A common issue is we sometimes receive job descriptions that have little or no formatting, or html styling. This makes it hard to read as a user, resulting in a poor user experience, and poor conversion metrics.

### Instructions

1. Create a program that takes a job description string that has no formatting (see 'raw' examples folder).
2. Using any method you like, return the text with valid html formatting, identifying as many features as you can (headings, paragraphs, lists).
3. We don't mind how you go about achieving the outcome. What we are looking for is how you think through the problem, followed by your technical implementation of it.
